## Key Insights
1. **Age and Costs**:
   - Positive correlation between age and medical insurance costs. Older individuals tend to pay higher premiums due to increased health risks.

2. **Smoking Habits**:
   - Smoking has the most significant impact on costs. Smokers pay substantially more than non-smokers, as smoking is considered a high-risk factor.

3. **BMI**:
   - Higher BMI is associated with higher costs, although its impact is less pronounced than smoking.

4. **Region**:
   - No significant differences in costs were observed across regions, suggesting individual factors outweigh geographical influences.

5. **Gender**:
   - No substantial cost differences between males and females, indicating gender is not a key factor in pricing.
